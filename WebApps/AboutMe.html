      About Me
    </h>
    <p>I'm currently a senior at Trinity University pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science planning to
      graduate this coming May.
      I enjoy learning and developing new sets of skills in the constantly changing technological world.
      I am currently a member of UPE and the Trinity University Symphony as a cellist.
      In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, piano and making music.
